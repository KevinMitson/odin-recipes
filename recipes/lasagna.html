After years of experimenting 
with different cooking methods for a
 standing rib roast, 
 I've finally perfected our 
 Christmas dinner. Dry-brining 
 the prime rib the day before roasting 
 means every bite is flavorful, and slow-roasting at a
  low temperature followed by a high-heat sear ensures a delicious
   medium-rare doneness throughout with a savory herb crust
