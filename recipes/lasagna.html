        After years of experimenting 
        with different cooking methods for a
         standing rib roast, 
         I've finally perfected our 
         Christmas dinner. Dry-brining 
         the prime rib the day before roasting 
         means every bite is flavorful, and slow-roasting at a
          low temperature followed by a high-heat sear ensures a delicious
           medium-rare doneness throughout with a savory herb crust
            </p>

    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (10 pound) bone-in standing rib roast </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>Â½ cup butter, softened </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix 500g strong white flour, 2 tsp salt and a 7g sachet of fast-action yeast in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the centre, then add 3 tbsp olive oil and 300ml water, and mix well. If the dough seems a little stiff, add another 1-2 tbsp water and mix well.</li>
        <li>Tip onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for around 10 mins.</li>
        
    </ol>
